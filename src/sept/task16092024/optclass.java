 1. Difference between = and  ==?

= This is a assignment operator it assigns a value for eg: int a =10 [This means a holds value 10].

== This is a relational operator and it compares 2 values for eg a==b [This means a is equal to b & it is true]

2. byte b = 10; long l = 10l; â†’ How much Byte will be used.

byte: 1 byte
long: 8 bytes

Total 9 bytes.

3.  (b+c) 30

4. Data will come in int form.

5. Ans is 75 refer below code.
